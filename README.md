Various Experiments from my Machine Learning Lab Educational Course

This repository has 10 .ipynb and 2 pdf files of all the experiments I performed in the Machine Learning Lab Course;
All of them were run on Google Colab;
Unfortunately I don't have datasets for all of them but I assure you you can find them in kaggle with minimum effort
The Experiments are as follows:
1. Linear Regression
2. Principle Component Analysis (PCA1 & PCA2)
3. Spam Emails Classifier
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. K-Means Clusteriing
6. Density Based Scan Clustering (DBScan) (with dataset)
7. Ensemble Learning (with dataset)
8. Graph Based Learning
9. Activation Function
10. Nearest Neighbour(NN) Classifer
11. Digit Classification using MLP
